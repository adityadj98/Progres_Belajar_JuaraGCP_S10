Overview
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

BigQuery ML is a feature in BigQuery that data analysts can use to create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

In this lab, you use a special ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. You use this data to create a classification (logistic regression) model in BigQuery ML that predicts customers' purchasing habits.

What you'll learn
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Use BigQuery to find public datasets
Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BigQuery ML
Evaluate and improve the performance of your machine learning model
Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
