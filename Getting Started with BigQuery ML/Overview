Overview
BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratise machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

There is an available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. In this lab, you use this data to create a model that predicts whether a visitor will make a transaction.

What you'll learn
In this lab, you learn how to:

Create BigQuery datasets
Create, evaluate, and use machine learning models in BigQuery
Prerequisite
To maximize your learning you should have a basic knowledge of SQL or BigQuery.
